<p>This web application was developed using ASP.NET Core 2.1 (Razor Pages).
    This web application was developed for my Capstone Information Systems final project for Liberty University.</p>
<p>The purpose of this web application is to work as an inventory management system for a company
    with three or more locations. For my hypothetical situation, there are two stores and a warehouse.
    Stock can be moved between the stores with shipments. Also, if an item's stock drops too low,
    a worker should be notified to ship extra inventory to that location.</p>
<p>This application was developed in full by myself in the span of 6-8 weeks with no prior .NET Core experience.</p>
