## Project Phase 1 and 2 and 3. Specific Requirements
Posted on Wednesday, October 24, 2018 @ 7:51 PM

Hello Class,

I have received several Emails pertaining to the deliverables for the 3 phases of this course. 

**First of all**, remember that your FINAL OBJECTIVE is to submit a fully working Information System at the end of the course.  This system is an extension of the use cases you created in the 474 class you have successfully completed.

**Second**: I suggest that you use the 474 work you completed to envision what the program will look like.   From that point, backward plan what you need to complete the IS before the course ends.

**Third**. Take the analysis from the "Second" suggestion above, and divide it into 3 parts: Phase 1, 2, and 3, and this is what I will expect each submission phase.

Ten

**Deliverables**:

**Phase 1.**

**During this phase of the project, you are creating and delivering the following information for phase one based upon the project that you “Designed in 474**

1. requirements for modeling that represent some aspect of a system, including textual, graphical, and mathematical models.
1. The FURPS: Functional, Usability, Reliability, Performance, and Security requirements.
1. Identifying your functional and nonfunctional requirements.
1. Create UML modeling techniques to graphically show use cases and their relationships with actors.
1. Articulate how the use cases will be used to develop an integration strategy across your IS.

**Phase 2:**

**During this phase of the project, you are creating and delivering the following information for phase TWO based upon the information you created in PHASE 1 ABOVE! You begin to code your project GUI’s**

1. Design a graphical user interface (GUI). MUST BE A LANGUAGE LEARNED IN THE PROGRAM!
1. Explain the concepts of user experience, user interface, and usability by humans.
1. Discuss the important principles of navigation through a software application.
1. Explain how a storyboard can be used to help with the user-interface design.
1. Design a relational database schema.
1.  Coded application Each of you have taken classes in some type of programming language during your course curriculum at Liberty University. If you have successfully passed those classes with a C- or better then you should have the ability to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you are not capable of using one of the programming languages to build an IS system, I can only advise you to return that coursework and text and learn how to create the GUI’s you will need for your IS. You can start coding as early as you like; however, the idea is to have a plan before you start the trip! Coding to early leads to roadblocks that you were not foreseen due to poor or no planning in PHASE 1!
 

**Phase 3:**

**During this phase of the project, you are creating and delivering the following information for phase THREE based upon the information you created in PHASE 2 ABOVE! Finish up everything! Complete your Database implementation**

1. Describe how you will deploy and implement the IS

1. Describe the four types of software tests and explain how and why each is used.

1. Describe several approaches to data conversion.

1. Provide your approach to system deployment and describe the advantages and disadvantages.

1. Provide a plan for configuration management, change management, and source code control to the implementation, testing, and deployment of a system.

 

This is the culmination phase of the project, it all comes together in the final week of the class.

Your final deliverable should include a working IS, that includes screen shots of the application running in all aspects of the system. You can place the screen shots on a word document with a caption under each picture explaining what is happening on the screen.

**_Do not forget to zip your final coded application as well, to include your word doc each phase as well._**

**WORD COUNT PER PHASE PAPER! AND REFERENCES**

If you write about each button, textbox, list box, or any objects on your GUI as it pertains to: Who, what, when where and why. You will easily have 200 words of content. Also, discuss the design and makeup of each diagram and its purpose, requirements etc.

**29 to 32 points**

Solution is operational, shows mastery of the subject, and includes deliverables promised to customer within the assigned schedule for this phase.  Over 2,000 words exist within the plan and/or report and over 7 unique scholarly sources exist that sufficiently support the solution. Student’s contribution is equal in quality and value as peer contributions.
