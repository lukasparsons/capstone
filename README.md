## **CAPSTONE PROJECT INSTRUCTIONS**

The capstone project assesses the program outcomes through a conclusion information system (IS) component that solves a business need.  Each phase of the project should include one Microsoft Word document that follows APA guidelines and one zip file containing the applicable programming code, development material, and/or system configuration.  

*Instructions for the capstone project are detailed below in three (3) phases.*

## **Phase I Capstone Requirements**

* General Outline
  * APA formatted paper
  * Cover page
  * Table of Contents (TOC)
  * Introduction and conclusion sections 
  * Each section must be well supported with the textbook, respected industry whitepapers, and scholarly information systems journal articles 

* Project Solution
  * Zip file including all work completed for the customer associated with the WBS that parallel the assigned modules/week.  For example:
    * WBS indicates 10 project tasks will occur during the assigned weeks leading up to the due date of this phase of the capstone, all code necessary to complete these tasks is necessary to include for credit
  * All files/code/configurations must identify the author’s effort using comment sections throughout.  For example:
    * // Lines 0-50 written by Anna Anderson
    * // Lines 50-100 written by Sam Smith
 * Biblical Worldview
   * Final project closeout will require Biblical worldview integration, begin planning for this in the early stages of the project’s implementation
   * Identify several Biblical principles that apply to working in a coordinated effort with others to achieve the solution
* Testing Evaluation Plan and Report
  * Create a plan for User Acceptance Testing (UAT)/evaluating the new IS.
  * Create a list of tasks that the user should be able to complete using the new IS. The system should fulfil both the user requirements and support all business and user scenarios.
* User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Report
  * Observe the user utilizing the new IS system and the tasks that the user should be able to complete using the new system. Take notes during testing.
  * Create an Excel spreadsheet to store the data collected during testing.
