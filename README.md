## This Application was Developed as my Capstone Project for my degree at Liberty University.

This application was built using ASP.Net Core 2.1 (RazorPages) and functions as an inventory management system for a small business.

The website is hosted online at http://capstoneims.azurewebsites.net and runs off of a MongoDB NoSQL, Document-based server.

I received an A+ for my work on this application and I am very proud of it and update it fairly regulary with tweaks and QoL updates.

If you have any questions about this application, feel free to contact me at lukasparsons2013@gmail.com
